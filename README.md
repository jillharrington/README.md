These are my answers to assignment 2:
  1) see jill.py
  2) No, no variables show up in the variable explorer
  1) I got the same answer for both
  2) I had to cheat and google this answer because I couldn't figure out what it did ony my own. Online they used the example of a clock, explaining how when trying to figure out what time it will be 7 hours after 8o'clock you can't just add those two numbers together, as our clock runs on a 12 hour cycle and 15 hours wouldn't make sense on that clock.  However when you use the command print(15%12) you get the answer 3, which is what time it would be 7 hours after 8o'clock. So the command modulo will give you the remainder of the first variable within the constraints of the second variable (I think).
  3) ** raises the first variable to the power of the next variable (ie 2**3 = 2x2x2, 4**4=4x4x4x4).  Using the // operation will divide the 2 numbers and round the answers to the nearest whole number (whereas the / operation doesn't round the answers.
  4) yes python follows order of operations
  1)see jill.py
  2)Yes, the letters that I set as variables now show up there
  4)No it doesn't have a problem with having two different variables with the same value
  5)No it didn't change the value of other variables
  6)After changing letter1 to z, letterx remained as the original letter1, which was j rather than z.  There are confines to varaible assignment within python and when running experiments you need to make sure that all of your variables are correct
Boolean exercises
  1) In python 1=1.0 but "1" does not equal "1.0". I think this is because although the values are the same the two integers are technically different
  2) Yes
  3)(1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" or 5==(3+2)), (1==1.0 and not "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2)), (1==1.0 or "1"=="1.0" and 5==(3+2)) I could only come up with 3 ways 
  5)Yes oddlist became a variable
  6)No i did not get an error message
  7)5
  8)It says it is a list
  5/6) Yes it lists all integers between 0 and 100
Dictionary exercises
  1)see about_me.py
  2) yes it was listed as a dictionary in the variable type
  3) The length is 4, determined by the number of things you list within the dictionary
Array Exercises
  1) see array.py. It seperates the values and puts the type as an array of floats
  2) python prints the array and puts the type as an array of string
  3/4) see array.py
